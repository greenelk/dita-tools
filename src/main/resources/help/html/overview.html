<h1>DITA Tools</h1>
<p>Copyright GREENELK.ORG 2015</p>
<p>The GREENELK DITA Tools Eclipse plugin provides some useful facilities for DITA authors and editors.
To perform the available actions:

<h2>Checking tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select a number of resources (projects, folders and files) in the Package Explorer or Project Explorer.</li>
<li>Right click, and then select <b>DITA Tools</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Where Used Checker</h3>
<p>The selected <b>dita/jpg/gif/png files</b> files are checked to see if they are referred to by any other file in the workspace. 
Informational, Warning, and Error markers are created and may be viewed in the <a href="./problemview.html">Problem view</a>.
<ul>
<li>Informational - jpg/gif/png file is referenced by at least one other file</li>
<li>Informational - dita file is referenced by at least one file, which is a <b>ditamap</b></li>
<li>Error - dita file is referenced by at least one file, but no <b>ditamap</b>s</li>
<li>Error - file is not referenced by any other file in the workspace</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The default is to scan <b>ditamap</b>, <b>dita</b>, <b>htm</b> and <b>html</b> filetypes, though 
this may be configured through the <a href="./preferences.html">Preferences</a> page.</p> 
<p>Note: As this needs to cross-reference the entire workspace it may take some time to complete, even if you've only selected a single file to check.</p> 

<h3>HREF Checker</h3>
<p>Selected resources are scanned and an attempt is made to resolve all <b>href</b> attributes. Check is also made that a title exists for scope="peer" references.
Informational, Warning, and Error markers are created and may be viewed in the <a href="./problemview.html">Problem view</a>.
The default is to scan <b>ditamap</b>, <b>dita</b>, <b>htm</b> and <b>html</b> filetypes, though 
this may be configured through the <a href="./preferences.html">Preferences</a> page. 
</p>

<h3>CONREF Checker</h3>
<p>Selected resources are scanned and an attempt is made to resolve all <b>conref</b> attributes. 
Informational, Warning, and Error markers are created and may be viewed in the <a href="./problemview.html">Problem view</a>.
Only <b>dita</b> files are scanned. 
</p>

<h2>Source &lt;=&gt; web mapping</h2>
<p>Tools that provide mapping between source files and their web equivalents</p>
<h3>Source file finder</h3>
<p>
If you are looking at your documentation on-line and you want to find where source for the web page, or image, is located in your workspace, just.
<ul>
<li>Display the page in your favourire web browser</li>
<li>Copy the URL for the webpage, or image, to the clipboard</li>
<li>Click on the <image src="images/internet.gif"/> icon on your eclipse toolbar and the file (if found) will be located in all open navigation panels</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<h3>DITA Web file finder</h3>
<p>
Right click on one or more dita, htm, or html files in your source tree and look for the "DITA Web File Finder" action. After the <a href="./preferences.html">preferences</a> are set,
 it will open up the equivalent file on a site it's been published to. You just have to supply one, or more, URL prefixes so the action 
 knows how to construct the full URL. Examples of URL prefixes are:  
<ul>
<li>External URL - http://www.company.com/v123</li>
<li>Internal URL for docs build output - http://intranet.company.com:9080/v124/index.jsp?topic=</li>
</ul> 
Clicking on this action will open up 3 web browser tabs with views on the respective webpages.
